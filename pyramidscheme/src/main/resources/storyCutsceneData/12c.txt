1; Heh: You did it. You actually did it.
1; Heh: I'll be completely honest. I didn't think you had it in you.
1; Heh: Being a duck and all.
1; Heh: But I suppose I should be the first to say... thanks!
1; Heh: You literally just saved the world, and everything in it.
1; Heh: And I don't mean figuratively, I mean literally! Heheh.
1; Heh: Anyway...
1; Heh: I suppose you'll be wanting to go home now.
1; The Duck: Quack.
1; The Duck:... Quack?
1; Heh: Oh, heheh. Yeah I may have taken that ability to talk back.
1; The Duck: Quack!
1; Heh: Sorry about that.
1; Heh: Can't really let you go around telling everyone how close the world was to destruction.
1; Heh: That's just bad business. Heheheh.
1; Heh: Anyway...
1; Heh: Thanks again. For everything. It's been swell.
1; Heh: Just wait till I get home and tell the tadpoles about this.
1; Heh: Heheheh.
