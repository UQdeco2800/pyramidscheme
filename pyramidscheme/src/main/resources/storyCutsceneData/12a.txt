2; Apophis: Mwhahahah! So you've finally come to face me?
2; Apophis: I wondered how long it would take you.
2; Heh: Apep! Your tyrannical chaos has gone on long enough.
2; Apophis: Don't call me Apep! It's Apophis now! APOPHIS!
2; Apophis: Didn't you get my email?
2; Heh: I deleted it without opening it.
2; Apophis: You bastard.
2; Apophis: Begone Heh! I banish you from this world and all others where my chaos reaches!
2; Heh: Duck! You must defeat him!
2; Apophis: Mwhahahah. That little frog was always heavy on the drama.
2; Apophis: Too bad he will perish, along with the rest of the fools that ever doubted APOPHIS!
2; Apophis: And for my final act of triumph I will now destroy you!
2; The Duck: Not a chance...
2; The Duck: Apep.
2; Apophis! MWHAHAHAH! You will die now!
