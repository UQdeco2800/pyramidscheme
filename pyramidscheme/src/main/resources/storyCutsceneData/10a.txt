1; The Duck: Ok, this is different...
1; Heh: Hmm... looks like you've passed through dimensions again.
1; The Duck: So where am I now?
1; Heh: You seem to be inside some sort of rollercoaster game.
1; The Duck: Ooohhh, I love rollercoasters! Where are..
2; Mysterious Spaceman: THIS IS NOT A ROLLERCOASTER GAME!!!  
2; The Duck: Who are you?
2; Lt. Davo: My name is Lieutenant Davo Duck.
2; The Duck: Well Davo, I have to say I'm disappointed there aren't any rollercoasters.
2; Lt. Davo: So am I, when I first found out I was so upset I starting shooting everything.
2; Lt. Davo: Now everything is dead and I'm all alone.
2; The Duck: How about a game of Pyramid Scheme to cheer you up?
2; Lt. Davo: Sure, a game of Pyramid Scheme is far better than hanging out in a coaster world with no coasters!
