1; You feel fowl.
1; The Duck: What the quack, where am I?
1; The Duck: Double quack, I can talk?!
2; Mysterious Frog Floating on Cloud: Hehehehe, hey there.
2; The Duck: Who are you? Where am I? What the quack is going on?
2; Heh: I am Heh. I'm a frog. But I'm also the God of Time. Heheheh.
2; Heh: It would appear that Apep, that vile snake you encountered has sent you here.
2; Heh: He's the God of Chaos by the way. Or so I've been toad.
2; The Duck:...
2; Heh: Hehehehe.
2; Heh: Anyway. Apep has started calling himself Apophis, but don't let that fool you. He's still Apep.
2; Heh: Good old Apep is always hatching these evil plans to destroy the world.
2; Heh: Heheheh classic Apep.
2; Heh: Anyway, what was I talking about? I frogot.
2; Heh: Hehehehe.
2; The Duck: Enough with the puns! What do you want with me? And why can I talk?
2; Heh: Well you're the Champion of Time now, as the prophecy's foretold.
2; Heh: And any good Champion of Time should be able to talk. So I bestowed that gift on you.
2; Heh: I am a god after all. Heheheh.
2; The Duck: This is a lot of exposition for me to handle.
2; Heh: Heheheh yeah. It is.
2; Heh: Anyway, you'll have to beat Apophis at cards to save the world.
2; The Duck: What? Why?
2; Heh: Because those are the rules! OKAY?
2; The Duck: Okay...
2; Heh: After you've defeated Apep and saved the world and all that stuff, you can return home.
2; Heh: We'll have to make sure you're ready for that though, he's quite good at cards. Even without hands to play with. Heheh, quite impressive when you think about it.
2; The Duck: So what does that mean?
2; Heh: Oh just a little bit of time travel, so that you can test your abilities against various historical figures, nothing too dramatic.
2; Heh: Did I mention that I'm the God of Time? I can do that you know.
2; The Duck: Yes... you did.
2; Heh: Oh. Heheheheh.
2; Heh: Anyway, I'm sure you'll find this whole story entirely ribbeting.
2; Heh: Heheheheh.
