1; Guard: Hey what's all this commotion?
1; Br'ock: The duck! The duck beat me at cards! What a bad day! A bad year! A bad life!
1; Guard: Nonsense. It's just a duck. Ducks can't play cards.
1; Br'ock: This one can! And it beat me!
1; Guard: Hmm...

1; Guard: Maybe this duck can play cards after all.
